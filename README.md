# l√¶rlings categorized github stars

Having dozens of stars doesn't really help, so I'll group them in categories:

- [**D**ecentralization technology](./decentralization.md)
- [text **E**ditors](./editors.md)
- [**H**acking, sigint, etc.](./hacking.md)
- [**M**achine learning, neural networks, etc.](./machinelearning.md)
- [**S**ystems programming](./systems.md)
- [**W**eb technology](./web.md)

- [other](./other.md)
